Welcome to PyBeats!!
To control the top 8 pads, use keys q, w, e, r, u, i, o, p.
To control the second row of pads, use keys a, s, d, f, j, k, l, ;.
The green pads allow overlap and are designed for drum sounds and sound effects.
The red pads do not allow overlap and should be used for samples.

You can change the sounds used by each pad by going in to the sounds folder and changing replacing the file
in each padsound file. Note that only one file can be in the padsound file at a time and each file must end in .wav.

Loopy is a program that can be used to play back keystrokes in the main pybeats software.
Upon opening loopy, press the space bar to begin recording and then play the beat. Recording Status
is shown by a red dot in the center of the window. Once you are done playing, press the space bar again
to stop recording. To play your recorded beats, press any number 1 - 9 on the keyboard. 

Playback loops 2^x times. For example, if you press 3 on the keyboard, your beat will loop 8 times.
